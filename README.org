* Compliment [[https://travis-ci.org/alexander-yakushev/compliment.svg?branch=master]]

  Compliment is a Clojure completion library and a successor to
  [[https://github.com/ninjudd/clojure-complete][clojure-complete]]. Compliment provides a fast, smart and extensible solution to
  complete vars, namespaces, class members, local bindings and whatever else
  custom sources can implement.

  You can use Compliment in the following editors/IDEs:

  - Emacs --- via [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider][CIDER]] and [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/ac-cider][ac-cider]]
  - Vim --- via [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace][vim-fireplace]]
  - [[https://nightcode.info/][Nightcode]]

  Also, I am so glad you came here. You look gorgeous today.

** Rationale

   I wrote Compliment specifically for you because you are amazing and I believe
   you deserve a matching completion lib. Here are the features it boasts:

   - *Speed.* Your time is too precious to wait for completion to happen.
     Compliment is designed to be fast and is carefully benchmarked to make sure
     no sudden performance drops appear. It allows Compliment to work
     effectively even on [[http://clojure-android.info][Android]].
   - *Smart completion.* Such a smart person like you is entitled to completion
     being smart as well. Default Compliment sources use various techniques to
     give more meaningful completion depending on the context, and allow some
     fuzziness in prefix.
   - *Extensibility.* Your insatiable passion for exploration won't be satisfied
     by a set in stone completion list. For this reason Compliment allows every
     library developer to write custom sources, so later other users of the
     library will have better experience utilizing it.

** Installation

   If you use Nightcode or Vim with vim.fireplace then you don't have to install
   anything at all --- Compliment will be already there for you. In case you are
   Emacs+CIDER user there are two completion "frontends" to choose from:

   - [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AutoComplete][auto-complete]] --- you will also have to install [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/ac-cider][ac-cider]] for Compliment to
     work.
   - [[http://company-mode.github.io/][company-mode]] --- CIDER has built-in support for company-mode completion,
     but it lacks documentation tooltips for candidates.

   If for some reason you want to use Compliment directly from your
   application add this to the =:dependencies=:

[[https://clojars.org/compliment][https://clojars.org/compliment/latest-version.svg]]

** Examples

   [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Examples][Here]] you can find examples of different completion scenarios
   Compliment supports so far.

** For developers

   See test files to get an idea how public API and completion
   sources work.

   To understand what is a context and how it works see [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Context][Context]] wiki
   page.

   How to write your own sources is explained on [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Custom-sources][Custom sources]] page.
